| January 6  |  9:20 - 9:55AM  | Most of this time was used to think how to approach this problem. The first thing I thought of was using a TST to store the dictionary words and also to make fast look ups. Additionally, I though about using bread first search to go through the boards and find all the possible words. However, after speaking to Mr. Blick, he showed me that Depth First Search would actually be more benificial than Bread First Search since with DFS you traverse the board in a single chain. And so, I reviewed DFS and created a stack since DFS uses a stack. |

I used a for loop to traverse through the dictionary words and inserted them into the TST. Additionally, after thinking for some time, I created a nested for loop to go through each letter in the board (like as the first letter in the chain). My next step is to create a function which actually goes through the board. |

Additionally, I have a boolean 2d array to keep track if the squares have been visited or not. Wrote pseudocode that would help me write the recursive function. |

Added 2 bases cases where if we are out of bounds or the square has already been visited, we return. I also wrote down an if statement to check if our prefix/word is in the dictionary, if so, add it to the arraylist of good words. I also wrote down all of the recursive steps where you go up, left, right, or down. |

I figured out that I needed to tweak the TST code because it kept returning the wrong amount of "good words." I figured out that the TST needed to be changed so that each node doesn't have a code assigned to it, only the "end node." Now I am running into infinite loop problems. |

I figured out that it occurs in the corner of the board but I am not sure why in my code it is happening. |
| January 12 |   4:30 - 5:00   |                                                                                                     After sending an email to Mr. Blick, he suggested to not use lookup and contains because they run in linear time. I use the hint he gave me and put the node as a parameter so the look up times is 1. This helped my method and made it so that I pass all the checks. Additionally, I tried to use a hashmap so that I didn't have to use contains from the array list (i use contains key instead), but I got very similar run times so I deleted it.  |
